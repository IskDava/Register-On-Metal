# Register-On-Metal
Made a code for Arduino to bassicly work like a register. It stores it value in binary (HIGH and LOW power in D3-D10). You can write a char (1 byte) on it and then read it as decimal (type "read" in Serial for reading and any char for writting). It will display written by ligths (8 lights - 8 bits).
